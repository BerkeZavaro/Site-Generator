# Template Structure

Each microsite consists of 5 pages. Here's what belongs on each:

## Landing page (`/[siteSlug]`)

- Hero section with a strong headline that uses or reflects the primary keyword.
- Short explanation of the problem/topic.
- A simple benefits section for the user.
- A clear CTA button that links to the main product URL from `config.json`.

## Information page (`/[siteSlug]/info`)

- Deeper explanation of the problem (e.g. why the issue happens, how it works).
- Causes, context, and how to manage or reduce the issue.
- Educational tone, not fear-based.
- One or more CTAs pointing to the product.

## Comparison page (`/[siteSlug]/comparison`)

- Compare relevant product types or categories (for example different kinds of supplements).
- Show pros/cons and where our product fits in.
- Honest, not obviously biased; the brand's product should still come out as a strong option.
- Clear CTA to the main product page.

## FAQ page (`/[siteSlug]/faq`)

- 6–12 FAQs based on what people might genuinely search or ask around that keyword/topic.
- Short, direct answers.
- Include at least one CTA or soft reminder of the product where it makes sense.

## Contact page (`/[siteSlug]/contact`)

- Simple way to contact the brand or navigate to the main site's contact / support channels.
- Can also include reassurance, trust signals, and a final link to the main site.

**Important**: Every page must contain at least one clear link or CTA to the `product.mainUrl` from `config.json`.
