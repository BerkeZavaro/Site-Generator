# Content Guidelines

## Inputs from config.json

Each field in `config.json` should influence the copy:

- **primaryKeyword**: Should appear naturally in headings and early in the content. This is the main search phrase the page targets.
- **secondaryKeywords**: Can be sprinkled throughout the content where relevant to capture related searches.
- **country**: Influences language, currency references, and any regional considerations.
- **demographics.ageRange**: Helps tailor the tone and examples to the target audience.
- **demographics.gender**: May influence examples and language choices.
- **demographics.householdIncome**: Can inform the value proposition and pricing context.
- **product.name**: Should be mentioned naturally throughout the content, especially in CTAs.
- **product.mainUrl**: The destination for all call-to-action buttons and links.
- **brand.name**: Can be mentioned to build trust and brand recognition.
- **brand.mainSite**: May be referenced for additional resources or contact information.
- **toneOfVoice** (optional): Overrides the default tone if specified.

## Voice & Style

- **English only.**
- **Default tone**: trustworthy, friendly, evidence-based.
- Sound like a real human writer, not robotic AI.
- Avoid fake testimonials or made-up statistics.
- Avoid aggressive or illegal medical claims; focus on education and realistic benefits.

## SEO & Intent

- Primary keyword should appear naturally in headings and early in the content.
- Secondary keywords can be sprinkled throughout, where relevant.
- The microsite aims mainly at bottom-of-funnel users but can also attract some organic traffic.
